							<h3>What does it do?</h3>
							<p>The goal of this project was to build an app that would allow me to study even when browsing the web. 
								I will often read books and then forget the content of them quickly. With this project, I can write down
								significant quotes, and then my browser will display them randomly to me at a selected interval. This way
								my browsing is interrupted with a reminder of the concept I learned. This could have applications for anyone wishing to
								remember information more effectively, whether they be a student, a self help reader, or someone simply looking to
								impress their friends. 
								</p>
								<h3>Languages Used</h3>
							<p>I wanted to build an application using a library I wasn't completely familiar with, so I chose to build the backend of this application in nodejs. 
								The frontend was built with jquery, and because it is a Chrome extension, building it into chrome presented unique challenges. 
							</p>
							<h3>What's next?</h3>
							<p>This is a project that I believe in, but it is a work in progress. It is completed enough for me to display it here, but there is plenty left to be done. 
								The issues in the Github repository present a more comprehensive but less organized list of all the improvements I would like to make. However, here is 
								a list of the main goals:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Create a mobile app</li>
									<li>Implement user verification</li>
									<li>Deploy to a remote server</li>
									<li>Deploy to the chrome store</li>
									<li>Build a small user base for beta testing</li>
									<li>Allow uploading of pictures</li>
									<li>Allow the creation and sharing of quote categories</li>
								</ul>
